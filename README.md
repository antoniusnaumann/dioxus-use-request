A small crate that adds a hook for simple GET requests and [convienient macro]("#Macro") to [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com).

## Example
### Function
Using the hook like this...
```Rust
let dog = use_request(&cx, (breed,), format!("https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breed}/images/random"));

cx.render(match dog {
    Success(val) => rsx!(img { src: "{val.message}"}}),
    Failure(err) => rsx!("Failed to load dog"),
    Loading => rsx!("Loading dog image!"),
})
```
...achieves the same as this snippet which uses the [Use Future Hook](https://dioxuslabs.com/guide/async/use_future.html):

```Rust
let dog = use_future(&cx, (breed,), |(breed)| async move {
        reqwest::get(format!("https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breed}/images/random"))
            .await
            .unwrap()
            .json::<RandomDog>()
            .await
    });
    
cx.render(match dog.value() {
    Some(Ok(val)) => rsx!(img { src: "{val.message}"}}),
    Some(Err(err)) => rsx!("Failed to load dog"),
    None => rsx!("Loading dog image!"),
})
```
### Macro
For additional convienience, you can also enable the `use_request!` macro. 

```TOML
[dependencies]
dioxus-use-request = { version = "0.1.4", features = ["macro"] }
```

It automatically extract the hook's dependencies from the given URL string.
Using the macro, the example from above looks like this:
```Rust
// Macro automatically extracts dependencies in curly braces (e.g. {breed}) from the given string literal
let dog = use_request!(cx, "https://dog.ceo/api/breed/{breed}/images/random");

cx.render(match dog {
    Success(val) => rsx!(img { src: "{val.message}"}}),
    Failure(err) => rsx!("Failed to load dog"),
    Loading => rsx!("Loading dog image!"),
})
```

## Installation
For instructions on getting started with Dioxus, please refer to their [Getting Started Guide](https://dioxuslabs.com/guide/index.html). 
To use this crate, simply add it as dependency in your Cargo.toml. Make sure to enable the "macro" feature if you want to use the `use_request!` macro:

```TOML
[dependencies]
dioxus-use-request = { version = "0.1.4", features = ["macro"] }
```
